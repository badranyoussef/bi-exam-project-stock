## Problem Statement
Title: Stock Price Prediction Based on Macroeconomic Factors

## Challenge:
How do changes in macroeconomic factors, like interest rates and inflation, affect the stock market development, and how can we predict these changes using historical data?

## Importance:
Macroeconomic changes have a direct impact on companies' borrowing costs and earnings, which in turn affect their stock prices. Being able to predict these changes can help investors make informed decisions and reduce market risks.

## Expected Solution:
This study will help us determine if the macroeconomic factors have a influence on the stock prices, and whether investors should invest or not, based macroecomomic factors.

We will work towards developing a machine learning model that predicts stock price changes based on historical macroeconomic factors. In this study we mainly focus on interest rate and inflation.

## Positive Impact:
The solution will provide investors and financial analysts with valuable insights that enhance their ability to forecast market movements. This will enable them to make more accurate decisions regarding their investments.

## Further questions to investigate
Preliminary results are that there are no correlation between the interest rate, infaltion rate and SP500 price what so ever. Which led to these quetions to further investigate the data.

1. What is the effect of an interest rate change on the index price X number of days after/before the change?
