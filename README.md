## Problem Statement
Title: Stock Price Prediction Based on Interest Rate Changes and Macroeconomic Factors

## Challenge:
How do changes in interest rates affect stock prices for companies across sectors, and how can we predict these changes using historical data?

## Importance:
Interest rate changes have a direct impact on companies' borrowing costs and earnings, which in turn affect their stock prices. Being able to predict these changes can help investors make informed decisions and reduce market risks.

## Expected Solution:
This study will develop a machine learning model that predicts stock price changes based on historical interest rate fluctuations and potentially other macroeconomic factors such as inflation and commodity prices. The model will analyze trends in stock prices and provide predictions that can be utilized by investors.

## Positive Impact:
The solution will provide investors and financial analysts with valuable insights that enhance their ability to forecast market movements. This will enable them to make more accurate decisions regarding their investments.
