## Which machine learning methods have you applied in the application?
DescissionTreeClassifier
## How accurate is your solution of prediction?
We split our time series data in 11 train/test sets and got a result of 0.56 accuracy on the training data, and 0.63 accuracy on the test data.
## How could you increase the accuracy?
We tried including different features (X), but did not get a better result.
Maybe we would increase the accuracy by introducing new data to our dataset and model.
We only base our month on data from one month, but we could base it on two months or three months, or use weeks.
